# CAD-Tools-for-VLSI-Design

This repository contains files for the implementation of three separate automated tools for testing and verification of VLSI Circuits.
This repo comprises mainly of three tools, each for ATPG using Podem algo, 2-level logic minimization using Espresso algorithm and a separate logic simulator specifically used for testing Boolean circuits.
